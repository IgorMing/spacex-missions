## Getting Started

# or `npm i`
```

let's run it!

```shell
$ yarn dev

# or npm run dev
```

## Tools used

- NextJS
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- [Apollo _(Client)_](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [React Responsive Carousel](https://github.com/leandrowd/react-responsive-carousel)
- [Eslint Plugin Import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import)

## Observations

- This was the first time I worked with Chakra, and I thought it's awesome. Really productive coding style declaratively. _(Remembered flutter)_
- I wondered to apply a dynamic amount of data to be retrieved _(current is `10` hardcoded)_. But I really get tired now. haha

Thank you guys! I hope you like it.
